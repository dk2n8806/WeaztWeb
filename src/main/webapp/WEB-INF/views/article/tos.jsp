							<p>Importantly, although Weazt is commonly referred to as an online marketplace, it is not a traditional "retailer." Instead, Weazt acts as a venue to match buyers and sellers. Weazt is not involved in the actual transaction between buyers and sellers and does not transfer legal ownership of items from the sellers to buyers. As a result, Weazt has no control over the items advertised, or the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to pay for items.</p>

							<h2 class="fontCap fnor">Usage Guidelines</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="blk-content">
							<p><strong>Third Party Content; Identity Verification:</strong> You understand that the Weazt, including Weazt booth chat, acts only as a marketing platform and technical interface between users and that Weazt does not itself verify the qualifications of users, nor does it evaluate or control in any ongoing manner exchanges between users. Any opinions or statements expressed by a user are of those of the user alone, and are not to be attributed to Weazt. Weazt cannot and does not assume responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, safety, reliability, timeliness, innocuousness, legality or applicability of anything said, written, posted, displayed or otherwise made available by any user.</p>
							<br/>
							<p>You understand that you may be exposed to content that you find offensive to you, and that you use the Weazt at your own risk.</p>
							<br/>
							<p>Please use caution, common sense, and practice safe trading when using Weazt. Please note that there are also risks of dealing with underage persons or people acting under false pretense. By using Weazt, you agree to accept such risks and that Weazt (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) is not responsible for any and all acts or omissions of users on Weazt.</p>
							<br/>
							<p>Weazt uses many techniques to verify the accuracy of the information Weazt's users provide to Weazt when they register on Weazt. However, because user verification on the Internet is difficult, Weazt cannot and does not confirm each user's purported identity. Thus, Weazt has established a user-initiated feedback system to help you evaluate with whom you are dealing. Weazt also encourages you to communicate directly with potential transaction partners through the tools available on Weazt. You may also wish to consider using a third party escrow service or services that provide additional user verification.</p>
							<br/>
							<p><strong>Prohibited, Questionable and Infringing Usage; Restricted Activities:</strong> Your Activities which results in Your Information (or any items listed) on Weazt shall not:</p>
							<br/>
							<ul class="lcs">
								<li><p>be false, inaccurate or misleading;</p></li>
								<li><p>be fraudulent or involve the sale of illegal, counterfeit, stolen items or items which violate the Terms of Use in any way;</p></li>
								<li><p>infringe upon any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary or intellectual property rights or rights of publicity or privacy;</p></li>
								<li><p>violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation (including, but not limited to, those governing export control, consumer protection, unfair competition, anti-discrimination or false advertising); Weazt also does not permit the listing of items that have been identified by the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) as hazardous to consumers and therefore subject to a recall;</p></li>
								<li><p>be defamatory, trade libelous, unlawfully threatening or unlawfully harassing;</p></li>
								<li><p>be obscene or contain child pornography</p></li>
								<li><p>contain any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots, easter eggs or other computer programming routines that may damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information;</p></li>
								<li><p>create liability for us or cause us to lose (in whole or in part) the services of our ISPs or other suppliers; and</p></li>
								<li><p>link directly or indirectly to or include descriptions of goods or services that:</p>
									<ul class="lcd">
										<li><p>are prohibited under this Agreement, the Privacy Policy, or other policy documents and community guidelines as posted on Weazt or;</p></li>
										<li><p>are identical to other items you have for sale but are priced lower;</p></li>
										<li><p>are concurrently listed for sale on a web site other than Weazt's (this does not prevent linking to or advertising an Weazt item from another web site); or</p></li>
										<li><p>you do not have a right to link to or include.</p></li>
									</ul>
									<p>Furthermore, you may not list any item on Weazt (or consummate any transaction that was initiated using our service) that, by paying to us the listing fee or the final value fee, could cause us to violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance or regulation, or that violates the Terms of Use.</p>
